# 53 — Generate-Config Wizard: Customer Feedback Batch r3

Seven customer feedback items on the Generate-Config wizard, shipped together
on `feat/genconfig-feedback-r3` (2026-07). Each section names the code and
the tests that pin it.

## 1. CZ automatic control/target orientation (item 1)

For CZ gates the pair roles follow the physics **automatically**: the
higher-`RF_freq` qubit becomes the **control**, the lower the **target**.
Pairs are drawn in step 4 before frequencies exist, so `czAutoOrient()`
(generate.js) re-runs on every qubit `RF_freq` commit — plus populate render,
review entry and build — and flips the **stored spec pair**, dragging along
everything keyed by its id: the `populate.pairs` bucket, the bucket's
`moving_qubit` **role** (swapped so the same physical qubit keeps the flux
pulse), pinned wiring lines, and allocation entries in both key forms
(`"q1-q2"` and QUAM `"q1-2"`). CR pairs and regenerate mode never flip.

Escape hatch: the CZ pair table's `order` column (`auto`/`manual`);
hand-editing the step-4 Control/Target dropdowns marks that pair `manual`.
Surfaces: a pair-order note under the pairs table, a reorder toast, a
review-step summary row, and — server-side — `run_build._cz_order_warning`
(a `_result.json` warning when a backwards CZ pair reaches the build; it
never flips post-populate, which would rename the QUAM pair id under
`populate.pairs` matching).

Tests: `generate_czorder_selfcheck.cjs` (E1–E8), `test_cz_order_warning.py`,
`test_generate_czorder.py`.

## 2. User-settable qubit naming (item 2)

Step 4's **Qubit naming** block: scheme presets `q1,q2,…` (historical
default), `q0,q1,…`, **grid letters** (`qA1, qA2, qB1, …` — letter = board
row, A = chip-bottom row; number = column+1; one-shot Apply, blocked while
any qubit is unplaced), and custom prefix + start — **plus** inline
per-qubit rename inputs.

Renames remap the whole identity web in ONE pass (`applyQubitIdMap`,
extracted from `renumberContiguous` — which now also remaps
`spec.twpas[].qubits`, a pre-existing gap): populate buckets, pair entries +
`populate.pairs` keys, TWPA lists; allocation drops for re-allocate.

Name rule (backed by real pipeline constraints, mirrored server-side in
`config_generator.validate_spec`): `^q[A-Za-z0-9_]+$` — leading lowercase
`q` (quam_builder keys `machine.qubits` as `q`+index; other prefixes orphan
populate values), no `-` (breaks `_parse_pair`), no whitespace, unique.

Hand renames set `namesTouched`: count changes keep the names (grow appends
free `q<k>`, shrink truncates) and the contiguity gate turns off. The three
formerly-hardcoded `q1…qN` gates (`stepGuards[4]`, `topologyBlocker`,
`syncTopoControls`) are scheme-aware via `expectedNamesOrNull()`.
Regenerate mode hides the controls and never renames.

Tests: `generate_naming_selfcheck.cjs` (F1–F8), validate_spec name-rule
cases in `test_config_generator.py`.

## 3. Immediate as-you-type validation (item 3)

Typed populate values validate **on the keystroke** (debounced 250 ms), per
cell and unit-aware — `15.3` typed in GHz mode flags "outside MW-FEM
hardware reach" before blur. Checks (`validateCellValue`, single-cell facts
only): drive RF 50 MHz–10.5 GHz / readout RF 2–10.5 GHz (mirrors
`diagnostics.py`), hand-typed LO vs band / ±0.4 GHz window / 5 MHz demod
hole, |amp| > 1 in any display unit, the **immediate feedline Σ|amp| > 1
clip while typing**, manual FSP [-11, 18] + integer grid, NaN/negative
nonsense. Errors = red border + ⚠ + tooltip; warnings amber.

Layering contract: inline = per-cell immediate; the conflict panel keeps
cross-cell findings at commit. The inline layer never writes panel entries
(sole deliberate overlap: the feedline clip). Full-table sweeps run on
render (draft restore / unit toggle / power-mode flip), LO rewrites, and
bulk fills. A JS↔Py parity test pins `VALIDATE_RANGES` / `BAND_RF_RANGES`
to `diagnostics` + `spec_constraints`.

Tests: `generate_validation_selfcheck.cjs` (D1–D13),
`test_generate_validation.py` (incl. `TestJsPyConstantsParity`).

## 4. Absolute-dBm power entry (item 4)

The absolute-power input mode (ported from the pre-scrub branch, commit
`feat(generate): absolute RF/dBm input mode + hole-aware LO solver`): a
**Power input** toggle adds a mode where pulse powers are typed in dBm and
the port `full_scale_power_dbm` auto-allocates — the customer's example
−20 dBm → FSP 0 / amp 0.1 is pinned by test. Readout is a bank edit (one
dBm per feedline, shared FSP, equal per-tone amplitudes) under the
coherent-sum budget. Users can still hand-set FSP + amplitude in manual
mode. Details in `docs/27_config_generator.md`.

**r3 extension**: the feedline **Σ|amp| > 1 CLIP warning is
mode-independent** — coherent tones summing past DAC full scale clip no
matter how the amplitudes were typed, so the readout-bank sweep also runs
in manual mode (`sumOnly`; per-tone + 0.5-headroom findings stay
absolute-only). Pinned by power selfcheck case C9.

## 5. Default-value presets archive (item 5)

Named default sets (pulse values, resonator timings, flux points, pair
seeds) save **server-side** (`instance/gen_presets/<slug>.json`, one file
per preset, atomic + locked — `core/gen_presets.py`) and re-apply to any
new chip via a preset bar atop step 6: select + Apply (fill-only-empty by
default, an "Overwrite existing values" toggle) + "Save as preset…" (name +
per-section checkboxes, Pulses default-checked) + Delete.

Capture rule: a column uniform across every valued row → `defaults` (what a
Set-all fill produces); differing rows → per-row `overrides`. Values are
BASE units straight from `spec.populate`. Never captured: `LO_frequency`
(re-derived from RF on apply), `grid_location`, CR target LO/IF. Apply
respects the chip (hidden sections skip, CR fields drop on a CZ chip,
unmatched row ids skip — all reported) and runs the step-entry refresh
sequence. Routes: `GET/POST/DELETE /generate/presets` (+ per-slug GET;
`needs_confirm` overwrite round-trip).

Tests: `test_gen_presets.py` (24), `generate_presets_selfcheck.cjs` (P1–P4).

## 6. Folder-browser stability + Linux (item 6)

Server `/browse`: empty path on POSIX lists `$HOME`; unreadable directories
return an `error` field at HTTP 200 (previously a silent empty listing / a
500 from the badge probes). Client (app.js): 8 s AbortController timeout
with typed failure reasons, a monotonic nav token (stale responses drop),
spinner, failure surface with Retry + Go-back, and the invariant that
`_currentPath` only ever holds a successfully-listed folder. The breadcrumb
builder is rewritten — POSIX paths previously produced backslash-joined,
leading-slash-less crumb targets (dead navigation on Linux); now POSIX /
drive / UNC all navigate. mkdir gains a double-submit guard + failure
re-sync. The browser reopens at the last successfully-listed folder **per
target input** (`quam_folder_last:<id>`), and step 7's destination mirrors
to `quam_gen_output_path` (survives a lost sessionStorage draft).

Tests: `test_browse_route.py`, `folder_browser_selfcheck.cjs` (G1–G5).

## 7. Editable Python build scripts (item 7)

`/generate/build` accepts `scripts_dir`; step 7 gains an "Also export
editable Python build scripts" toggle + folder picker. After a successful
build, `core/script_emitter.py` writes a readable, tutorial-style bundle
with the chip's actual values **inlined**: `01_make_wiring.py`,
`02_build_machine.py`, `03_generate_config.py`, `README.md`. Best-effort:
an emission failure lands in `scripts_error`, never fails the build.

Fidelity by construction: (1) `01` adds connectivity lines in exactly
`build_connectivity`'s order and allocates once, so the allocator
reproduces the wizard's ports (allocated ports inlined as comments);
(2) `02`'s populate + 2Q-gate machinery is extracted **verbatim** from
`generator/run_build.py` at emit time via `inspect.getsource` — in-sync by
construction. Verified end-to-end in a real QM env: the wizard build and
the emitted scripts produce JSON-identical `state.json`/`wiring.json`
(`test_script_emitter_live.py`, auto-skips without an env).

Sibling: `core/regen_script.py` (Re-generate's one-file calibration-repo
recipe) stays as-is; this bundle targets the wizard's own quam_builder
idiom so it needs no `quam_config` template repo.

Tests: `test_script_emitter.py` (15 + golden under
`tests/golden/scripts_bundle_cz/`), `test_script_emitter_live.py`.

# r3.1 — Step-4 "Qubits" page readability redesign (flow bands)

Customer follow-up: the Qubits page was "not good at reading" — a
~3-viewport single-column stack that hid the chip board and qubit naming
behind collapsed `<details>`, drowned the controls in 9 paragraphs of
prose, rendered the Grid cols×rows inputs stacked (a Pico specificity bug:
`input{width:100%}` at (0,1,1) beat `.gen-topo-dim{width:3.2em}` at
(0,1,0)), and labeled CZ pairs "Control/Target" before frequencies exist.
Principles: Seamlessness, Conciseness, Stability.

## Layout: three flow bands (reading order = doing order)

1. **DEFINE** — architecture select + its 1-line dynamic note, qubit count +
   per-feedline inline, a live confirmation caption ("3 qubits · 2
   feedlines: q1–q2 · q3"), the **read-only control-line confirmation
   block** (explicitly labeled "For confirmation — control lines this
   architecture wires:", controls disabled by design — they were already
   dead-derived from the architecture selector; the gate note echoes the
   live pair count), and the **always-visible naming row** (scheme select +
   Apply + rename chips).
2. **LAYOUT** — band header carries the placement-progress caption (tinted
   `--color-warning-text` while partially placed — pre-announcing exactly
   what the Next-gate rejects) + the reserved Renumber slot; presets +
   Grid inputs inline; then the **always-visible board** (left, ~2/3) with
   the **pair list as its side-by-side textual mirror** (right rail,
   height-locked to the board's 56vh, internal scroll). The 4-bullet
   gesture list became one 11.5px line + an ⓘ tooltip; a count-0 board
   shows "Set the qubit count to start placing." instead of a dead grid.
3. **TWPAs** — one caption line + list + add.

Wraps to a single column under ~790px container width (flex-wrap, house
idiom — no media query). Zero `<details>` remain on step 4.

## Gate-aware pair headers

CZ chips: neutral **"Qubit ↔ Qubit"** header + a one-line caption
("Control/target assigned automatically from qubit frequencies at Populate
(higher = control)") — step 4 no longer pretends to know CZ roles. Rows
whose `cz_order` is pinned show a restrained **manual** chip (previously
invisible state). CR chips keep **"Control → Target"** with the `→` glyph
(the board draws the matching arrowhead); the direction there is a physical
choice made on this step.

## JS contract change

The board renders **unconditionally**: `render()`'s step-4 branch,
`applyChipArch`, and `renderQubitsStep` all call `WiringGrid.refresh()`
(guarded on `window.WiringGrid` for selfcheck worlds); the `<details>`
toggle listener is gone; `renderQubitsStep` also mirrors the count-derived
zone into the Grid inputs. `WiringGrid.render()` is a pure innerHTML build
(no layout reads) — safe at 200 qubits and into `display:none` panels.

## Step-6 reference mirrors

LO map / Chip topology / Wiring diagram now **default OPEN** (user
feedback: SM shows its reference panels; an explicit collapse is remembered
per user via the existing localStorage keys). The faint right-arrow toggle
became an explicit **Show/Hide pill** (pure CSS off `details[open]`, so the
render functions rewriting summary text can't break it).

Tests: `generate_step4_layout_selfcheck.cjs` (L1–L5) +
`test_generate_step4_layout.py`; topoboard selfcheck updated (no more
`details.open` plumbing — the board renders from the count change alone).

# r4 — Populate arrow-nav · built-in defaults · breadcrumb root-jump fix

Third feedback round (2026-07-17), built in an isolated worktree while a
parallel session worked the main checkout.

**Arrow-key grid navigation (Populate).** `popGridKeydown` (one delegated
keydown per `gen-pop-table`): → leaves a box only from the caret END, ←
only from the START (mid-text arrows keep native caret movement); ↑/↓
always move within the column, including the Set-all row; selects are
never hijacked; disabled cells (absolute-mode FSP) are skipped; the target
cell selects its text (retype-ready). Pinned by
`generate_popnav_selfcheck.cjs` N1–N6.

**Built-in "Standard defaults" preset.** `gen_presets.builtin_standard()`
— always first in `/generate/presets`, undeletable, reserved name. Values
(base units): x180 40 ns / **0.25** / DRAG α **1.0**, saturation 10 µs /
0.1, readout 1000 ns / 0.1, depletion **10 µs**, ToF 28 ns, anharmonicity
−200 MHz, CZ 100 ns / 0.1 V, CR 1.0 / 0.1 (bold = the maintainer's picks;
the rest run_build seeds / QM conventions). Chip-specific values
(frequencies/LO/FSP/grid/flux) are never in it. Apply flow unchanged.

**Folder-browser root-jump (also State/Dataset load).** Root cause: the
`/browse` prefix-completion branch answered a dead path with
`path = parent` while listing completions — crumbs desynced and a stale
Recent entry cascaded to the drive root. Now the autocomplete keeps
completion behind `?complete=1`, and the dialog gets **ancestor-walk**
semantics: a dead path lands at its nearest existing folder with a
`missing` marker → warning note + truthful breadcrumbs. POSIX paths gain
an explicit `/` root crumb; bare `D:` normalizes to `D:\` (CWD-relative
footgun). Pinned by the browse-route ancestor-walk suite + selfcheck
G6–G8.

# r5 — dataset-aware picker · statistical trends · global UI scale · multi-select compare

Fourth feedback round (2026-07-17), built in the isolated worktree. **Held
off main pending the maintainer's browser verification.**

**Dataset-aware folder picker.** The Dataset Load picker passes
`kind=dataset`; `/browse` then marks children carrying `node.json` /
`data.json` (`dataset_dirs` + `has_dataset`) and the dialog highlights
those (green `is-dataset`) instead of `quam_state` folders — each picker
now highlights what its caller is hunting.

**Statistical trend layer.** `rollingStats` + `trendStatTraces` (app.js):
a centered moving-average line with a shaded ±σ band (window auto-scales,
n≥5), color-derived fill, one legend entry, hover-silent band edges — on
the Param History drawer chart AND the /trends mini charts. Band traces
render first (beneath the data, and they pin the category-axis order).

**Global UI scale (readability, the critical one).** Settings gains
"UI scale" (A− / % / A+): CSS `zoom` on `<html>`, 80–150% in 10% steps,
persisted (`quam_ui_scale`) and applied **pre-paint** by the head inline
script — the pragmatic whole-app control given ~100 hardcoded px font
sizes that the rem-based S/M/L setting never touched (that setting now
also applies pre-paint; its active-state selector was over-broad and
would have lit unrelated buttons). Plus: dark-mode muted text brightened
(#9aa0a6 → #b3bac2), Generate band titles brighter/bolder with stronger
hairlines.

**Sidebar multi-select → compare.** File-manager convention instead of
drag-rubber-band (finicky in a scrolling tree): SHIFT-click a compare
checkbox to select the whole range since the last click; the Compare /
Trend buttons echo the live count, a Clear chip appears, and checked rows
tint. Delegated on document, so htmx tree re-renders keep the behavior.

Tests: `ui_readability_selfcheck.cjs` R1–R5 + wrapper; `TestDatasetKind`
in the browse-route suite.
